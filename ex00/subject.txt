You must include a README.md file in your repository explaining briefly the
project and how to run it.
• The game is played on a 4x4 grid, where each cell can contain a tile with a value
that is a power of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, up to 2048).
• Initial Setup: The game starts with two tiles randomly placed on the grid, each
with a value of either 2 or 4.
• User Input: Players use the keyboard arrow keys to move tiles in the following
directions:
◦ Up Arrow: Move tiles up.
◦ Down Arrow: Move tiles down.
◦ Left Arrow: Move tiles left.
◦ Right Arrow: Move tiles right.
• Tile Movement: Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they
hit the edge of the grid or another tile.
• Merging Rules:
◦ When two tiles with the same value collide, they merge into one tile with a
value equal to their sum.
◦ Merging increases the player’s score by the value of the merged tile.

◦ Merging happens only once per move per tile.
• Score Tracking: The player’s current score is displayed and updates with every
merge.
• End Game Condition:
◦ The game ends when the grid is full and no valid moves are possible (i.e., no
adjacent tiles can merge).
◦ A "Game Over" message notifies the player, with an option to restart the game.
• Winning Condition:
◦ Players win the game by creating a tile with the value of 2048.
• Restart Functionality: A "Restart" button allows players to reset the game to
its initial state.
• Visual Feedback:
◦ Provide animations for tile movement and merging.
◦ Display messages for winning and game over scenarios using alerts or modals
